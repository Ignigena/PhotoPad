    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <h2 style="margin-top: -15px;">Connecting your EyeFi Card</h2>
    <p>Before your EyeFi card can connect to the app you'll first need to plug it into a computer to configure it.  This will link your EyeFi card to the WiFi network you'll be using and give you an authentication key for the card itself.  When you connect the card to your computer, run the setup and installation program included and upgrade the card to the latest firmware.  Link the card to your WiFi network and disable all special features especially the "Relayed Transfer" feature as this can interfere with the card communicating with this app.</p>
    <p>Once the card is setup you can eject it from your computer and close all EyeFi apps.  This includes both the "Eye-Fi Center" app which you used to setup your card, and the "Eye-Fi Helper" app which launches automatically and can be found in your menu bar.  <b>It is very important that neither of these apps are running as they can interfere with this app.</b></p>
    <p>Open the following file in any text editor on your computer:</p>
    <h2>~/Library/Eye-Fi/Settings.xml</h2>
    <p>and locate the <b>"Upload Key"</b> found in this file.  Once you have your upload key, go to Settings on this device and enter the upload key exactly as found in this file.</p>
    <p>Now you're all set!  As long as this app is running and on the same network as you setup the card earlier, the Eye-Fi card will download pictures wirelessly to this app.  Feel free to customize the title and color scheme to fit your event ... or just your mood!</p>
